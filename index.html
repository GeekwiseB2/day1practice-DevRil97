    <h1>My Story with Bitwise:<h1>
    <p>My story with Bitwise starts with my best friend he asked me to start taking courses at Geekwise Academy with him cause it seemed like something we would both like and would give us the skills to get jobs in the field we want to work in. I took the first class and loved it so now im back and taking the second class Mobile Friendly Website Building and hoping to get a job in the industry soon.</p>
